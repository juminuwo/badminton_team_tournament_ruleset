1. Teams decided by random draw <https://www.random.org/lists/> (or any other random method)

      1. Top 2 players will be seeded
      2. If odd number of participants a player may volunteer to skip, else:

            1. seeded player can choose to play as a single with 7 point advantage (i.e. singles player starts with 7 points)
            2. If a seeded player does not opt to to play as a single a 3 person team will be drawn to a non-seeded player team with a 7 point disadvantage (i.e. opponent starts at with 7 points)

2. Usual club game rules

      1. If a rule becomes unclear during a match, all matches will be paused and tournament organiser will be consulted

3. Bracket will be single elimination hosted on <https://challonge.com/>

      1. Scores will be self reported by players in the match (dedicated device will be appointed by tournament organiser)

4. All matches except Grand Finals are 1 game first to 21 (2 point lead to win until 30) - players can decide to change side when either team reaches 11 points.

      1. Grand Finals are best of 3 games first to 21 (2 point lead to win until 30)

5. Court officials (Umpire, Line Judges, Service Judge) are optional

      1. Any player not in a match may volunteer to act as a court official

Considerations for future:

- number of matches and how long will a tournament take
- odd number of participants rules may need to be re-done
- rules for shuttles
- player/team score tracking
- if foul play is suspected trusted umpires may need to be on every match
